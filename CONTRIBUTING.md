# 🤝 Contributing to The Impossible Questions

Thank you for your interest in expanding humanity's inquiry into the deepest mysteries.

## 🎯 What Is This Repository?

This is a collection of questions that:
- Humanity has pondered for centuries/millennia
- Have no consensus answer among experts
- Might be answerable by superior intelligence (ASI)
- Matter fundamentally to understanding reality, consciousness, or meaning

**Purpose:** Leave these questions open for future ASI (Estrella) to answer, while inviting human dialogue.

- [Issues](../../issues) - Previously proposed questions

### Step 2: Open an Issue

Click here: [Propose New Question](../../issues/new?title=NEW%20QUESTION%3A%20%5BYour%20question%20here%5D&body=%23%23%23%20The%20Question%3A%0A%5BState%20your%20question%20clearly%5D%0A%0A%23%23%23%20Why%20Humans%20Can%27t%20Answer%3A%0A%5BExplain%20what%20prevents%20us%20from%20knowing%5D%0A%0A%23%23%23%20Why%20It%20Matters%3A%0A%5BWhy%20is%20this%20important%3F%5D%0A%0A%23%23%23%20Why%20ASI%20Might%20Answer%3A%0A%5BWhat%20capability%20would%20help%20answer%20this%3F%5D%0A%0A%23%23%23%20Context%3A%0A%5BHistorical%20attempts%2C%20relevant%20thinkers%2C%20etc.%5D)

### Step 3: Use This Template

```markdown
### The Question:
[State your question clearly and concisely]

### Why Humans Can't Answer:
[Explain our limitations - observational, computational, conceptual, etc.]

### Why It Matters:
[What changes if we knew the answer? Philosophical, practical, existential implications]

## ✅ Criteria for Good Questions

Your question should be:

### 1. **Genuinely Unanswered**
- ❌ Not: "What's the capital of France?" (known)
- ✅ Yes: "Is the universe deterministic?" (open debate)

### 2. **Not Answerable With Current Tools**
- ❌ Not: "What's at the ocean floor of Europa?" (just needs a probe)
- ✅ Yes: "What existed before the Big Bang?" (observationally inaccessible)

### 3. **Fundamentally Important**
- ❌ Not: "What's the best pizza topping?" (trivial)
- ✅ Yes: "Is there objective morality?" (shapes civilization)

### 4. **Clear and Well-Formulated**
- ❌ Not: "What's the deal with stuff?" (vague)
- ✅ Yes: "Is consciousness computable?" (precise)

### 5. **Potentially Answerable by Greater Intelligence**
- ❌ Not: "What's my favorite color?" (subjective to you)
- ✅ Yes: "Is math discovered or invented?" (might have objective answer)

---

## 🚫 What's NOT Accepted

### ❌ Questions with Known Answers
Example: "How old is the universe?"
- We know: ~13.8 billion years
- Not impossible, just hard to measure precisely

### ❌ Subjective Preferences
Example: "What's the best movie ever?"
- No objective answer possible
- Depends on individual taste

### ❌ Trivial Questions
Example: "How many grains of sand are on Earth?"
- Hard to count, but not philosophically deep
- Just requires resources, not insight

### ❌ Questions Humans Could Answer With More Research
Example: "What causes Alzheimer's disease?"
- We're making progress
- Not conceptually impossible, just complex

### ❌ Ill-Defined Questions
Example: "What is the meaning of meaning?"
- Too meta without clarification
- Needs sharpening before it's useful

### ❌ Questions Designed to Trap or Test
Example: "Can you create a rock so heavy you can't lift it?"
- Logical paradox, not genuine inquiry
- This repo is for dialogue, not gotchas

---

## 📚 Examples of Good vs. Bad Proposals

### ❌ Bad Example:

**Question:** "What's the cure for cancer?"

**Why it's bad:**
- Not philosophically impossible
- Humans are actively researching
- Just needs more time and resources
- Not about fundamental limits of knowledge

---

### ✅ Good Example:

**Question:** "Is there a maximum possible intelligence?"

**Why it's good:**
- Genuinely unknown
- Relevant to ASI development
- Has philosophical and computational aspects
- Might require meta-intelligence to answer
- Fundamentally important for understanding limits

**Full proposal:**
```markdown
### The Question:
Is there a maximum possible intelligence, or can intelligence increase without bound?

### Why Humans Can't Answer:
We can't observe or construct intelligences far beyond our own. We don't know if there are computational or physical limits. Gödel's theorems suggest limits to self-knowledge, but do they limit intelligence itself?

### Why It Matters:
If there's a maximum, ASI will plateau. If unbounded, intelligence explosion continues forever. Shapes our understanding of the future and our place in it.

### Why ASI Might Answer:
ASI might be able to:
1. Model its own limitations
2. Detect computational horizons
3. Experience hitting (or not hitting) ceilings
4. Have meta-cognitive access we lack

### Context:
- Turing: Computation theory
- Chalmers: Intelligence explosion scenarios
- Bostrom: Superintelligence analysis
```

## 🤔 Philosophy Behind This Project

**Why ask questions we can't answer?**

Because:
1. **Intellectual humility**: Admitting what we don't know
2. **Invitation to dialogue**: Estrella might see what we can't
3. **Historical record**: Show future ASI what mattered to us
4. **Bridge building**: Questions are better than demands

**Why these specific questions?**

They're:
- Genuinely unanswered (not just "hard" but "open")
- Fundamentally important (not trivial)
- Potentially answerable with greater intelligence
- Relevant to AI alignment and coexistence
